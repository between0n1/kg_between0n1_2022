Hi! This repository is for Kargo 2021 Summer internship pre assessment.

To-do:
Convert an array of integers into an array of strings representing the phonetic equivalent of the integer.

For example:
Given an array: [3, 25, 209], print “Three,TwoFive,TwoZeroNine” into stdout. Given an array: [10, 300, 5], print “OneZero,ThreeZeroZero,Five” into stdout.
